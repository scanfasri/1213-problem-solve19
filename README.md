Problem Solve 19
1) This program asks the user to type in a width and height. Then it makes a rectangle using those numbers. It shows the rectangle info and also calculates the area by multiplying width × height. It uses the built-in Rectangle class and Scanner to get user input.

2)This file creates a Circle class. It can store a radius and color. You can:

- Set the radius and color,

- Get the radius and color,

- Get the area of the circle (it uses π × r² to calculate it).

The area is automatically figured out when you ask for it.
